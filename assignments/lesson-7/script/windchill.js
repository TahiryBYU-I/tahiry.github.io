/* The formula to calculate the wind chill factor is LaTeX: f=35.74+0.6215\:t-35.75\:s^{0.16}+0.4275\:t\:s^{0.16}
f = 35.74 + 0.6215 t − (35.75 s ^ 0.16) + (0.4275 t s ^ 0.16)
, where f is the wind chill factor in Fahrenheit, t is the air average temperature in Fahrenheit, and s is the wind speed in miles per hour. */
